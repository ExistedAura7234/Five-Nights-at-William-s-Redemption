In this level we will play the rol from W.A, who awaked from a large nightmare in a Hospital. The doctors leaved a recording that says to you that you´re fine and in the morning you can back home, also they explain that they don´t know how did you survive ´cause the 99% of your body was burned.
The gameplay is simple, you are sitted on the bed and there are two courtins next to you. In the right one is Chica, in the left one is Bonnie and behind the bed is Freddy. They are Psicotronics, remanent of your nightmare, but if you are really scared with them yu will die
To survive you must use your flashlight at the same way that Evan had do it in FNAF 4, Freddy only will appear when you have no power. The flashligt can be used per 2 minutes (the night lasts 6 minutes)
